### ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

#### 1. **Missing Entity CRUD Tests**
- **Event**: Hoàn toàn thiếu tests
- **Tension**: Hoàn toàn thiếu tests  
- **Full CRUD**: Chỉ có Create tests, thiếu Read/Update/Delete

#### 2. **Missing Relationship Tests**
- **AssignsTaskRel**: Agent → Task assignment
- **IsPartOfProjectRel**: Task → Project membership
- **ResolvesTensionRel**: Task → Tension resolution
- **RequiresResourceRel**: Task/Project → Resource dependency
- **HasSkillRel**: Agent → Skill mapping

#### 3. **Missing Complex Workflow Tests**
- **Project Lifecycle**: End-to-end project management
- **Agent Assignment**: Complete agent workflow
- **Tension Resolution**: Core TRM-OS functionality
- **Resource Management**: Resource allocation and tracking

#### 4. **Missing Edge Cases**
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid data handling
- **Constraint Violations**: Relationship constraints
- **Concurrency**: Multiple users, race conditions
- **Performance**: Large data sets, bulk operations
